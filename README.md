# QuantumComputing-QisKit-One
This is the GitHub repository for my first attempt at learning Quantum Computing using QisKit.
In this project, I am creating a single circuit with qubits. 

To get this code working:
1) Install VSC (Visual Studio Code) and Python (any version).
   
3) Install the packages. Run cmd and install all of these:
   pip install qiskit
   pip install numpy
   pip install jypyterlab
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install qiskit-ibmq-provider

5) Copy the code from the file and save it.

6) Access the terminal (normally by pressing ctrl and " ' " ). Type in "jupyter lab" and press enter.
   
7) Run the code and all should work :)
